# Ela Chitu - Chit Fund Management System

## Overview
Ela Chitu is a digital platform to manage traditional Chit Fund operations, ensuring transparency and ease of management for Foremen and Subscribers.

## Workflow
1.  **Group Formation**: A fixed number of subscribers agree to contribute a specific amount monthly for a set period.
    *   *Example*: 10 members x ₹1,000 for 10 months = ₹10,000 pot/month.
2.  **Monthly Pool**: Individual contributions are pooled every month.
3.  **Auction/Bidding**: Members bid for the pooled amount. The member who offers the highest discount (lowest take-home amount) wins.
4.  **Distribution**:
    *   **Foreman Commission**: A percentage of the discount goes to the Foreman.
    *   **Dividend**: The remaining discount is distributed among non-winning members, reducing their next contribution.
5.  **Cycle Completion**: The process repeats until every member has won the pot once.

## Features
- **User Roles**: Foreman (Admin), Subscriber (Member).
